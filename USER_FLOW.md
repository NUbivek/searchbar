## Search Flow Overview

The Research Hub Search Application follows this high-level flow:

```
User Query → Context Detection → Source Selection → Parallel API Calls → 
Result Processing → Metrics Calculation → Result Filtering → 
Result Ranking → LLM Enhancement (optional) → Result Display
```

### Detailed Flow Steps

1. **User Query Input**
   - User enters a search query in the main search bar
   - Query is processed for special characters and formatting
   - System detects special commands or operators

2. **Query Context Detection**
   - System analyzes query to determine context (financial, medical, etc.)
   - Context detection uses keyword matching and pattern recognition
   - Context determines which sources to prioritize and scoring weights

3. **Source Selection**
   - Based on context, appropriate sources are selected
   - Source selection considers user preferences if available
   - API parameters are prepared for each selected source

4. **Parallel API Calls**
   - Multiple API calls are made simultaneously to different sources
   - Rate limiting is applied to prevent API throttling
   - Timeouts are set to handle non-responsive sources

5. **Result Processing**
   - Raw results from different sources are normalized to a common format
   - Duplicate results are identified and merged
   - Results are enriched with additional metadata

6. **Metrics Calculation**
   - Each result is scored on relevance, accuracy, and credibility
   - Context-specific weights are applied to each metric
   - Overall score is calculated as a weighted average

7. **Result Filtering**
   - Results below threshold scores are filtered out
   - Content policy filters are applied
   - User preference filters are applied if available

8. **Result Ranking**
   - Results are ranked by overall score
   - Additional ranking factors may be applied (source diversity, etc.)
   - Top results are selected for display

9. **LLM Enhancement** (optional)
   - If enabled, top results are sent to LLM for synthesis
   - LLM generates a comprehensive answer with proper attribution
   - Original results are preserved alongside the synthesized answer

10. **Result Display**
    - Results are rendered in the appropriate UI components
    - Metrics and source information are displayed
    - Interactive elements are activated
