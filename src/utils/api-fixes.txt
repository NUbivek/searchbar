# API Fixes Needed

## 1. In src/pages/api/search/index.js:

Change this line:
```javascript
llmResponse = await processWithLLM(results, query, model);
```

To:
```javascript
llmResponse = await processWithLLM({
  query,
  sources: results,
  model,
  maxTokens: 2048,
  temperature: 0.7
});
```

## 2. In src/pages/api/search/open.js:

The current implementation appears already correct with:
```javascript
llmResponse = await processWithLLM({
  // parameters in correct format
});
```

## 3. Finally, ensure the llmProcessing.js file has the export statement at the end:
```javascript
// Export the main functions
module.exports = {
  processWithLLM,
  isBusinessRelatedQuery,
  createFallbackResponse,
  createDetailedFallback,
  createErrorFallback
};
```

This will fix the LLM API integration between the various parts of the application.
